# Hi-Five task
Please use CodeSandbox to complete the following tasks https://codesandbox.io/s/vigilant-moon-p3bymw

## Task 1
Please write a website that allows user to check numbers from 1 to 99 such that:
1. If the number is a multiple of 3, you need to print "Hi".
2. If the number is a multiple of 5, you need to print "Five".
3. If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, you need to print "Hi Five".

Please trigger the check only when user clicks on a “Check” button on the page.

## Task 2
1. Refactor the logic of task 1 to a function. The function checks a number and returns the result. So, instead of printing the results, please return the string. 
2. List a number of test cases for this function.
